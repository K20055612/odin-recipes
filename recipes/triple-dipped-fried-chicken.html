    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This fried chicken batter yields the <strong>crispiest</strong>, <strong>spiciest</strong>, homemade fried chicken I have ever tasted! It is equally good served hot or cold and has been a picnic favorite in my family for years.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>4⅓ cups all-purpose flour, divided</li>
        <li>1½ tablespoons garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>1½ cups beer, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix together 3 cups flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning in a medium bowl.</li>
