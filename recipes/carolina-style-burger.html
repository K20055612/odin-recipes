    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I'm showing you how to do a <strong>"whole hog"</strong> barbecue without a 6-foot-long barbecue pit, which you <em>probably</em> don't have, and without a whole hog, which you <em>definitely</em> don't have. While you probably could get those things if you really needed to, by using this experimental, mini version, you really don't have to. Serve on buns.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2½ pounds baby back pork ribs</li>
        <li>1¾ pounds pork shoulder roast</li>
        <li>1¼ pounds pork tenderloin, trimmed</li>
        <li>1 pound pork belly, skin removed</li>
        <li>¾ pound pork sirloin roast</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the rub</h3>
    <ul>    
        <li>5 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons smoked salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut ribs, pork shoulder, tenderloin, pork belly, and pork sirloin in half.</li>
        <li>Combine kosher salt, brown sugar, smoked salt, smoked paprika, black pepper, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne for dry rub in a small bowl with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Season cuts of meat on both sides with dry rub; reserve about 4 teaspoons of the rub to season the cooked pork if needed after tasting.</li>
        <li>Place a piece of heavy-duty foil on a sheet pan. Place a half of ribs down in the center of the foil; top with shoulder, tenderloin, pork belly, and sirloin. Top with other rib half. Wrap tightly in 3 more layers of foil. Transfer to a Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Roast in the preheated oven until meat is falling off the bone and very, very tender, about 9 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove bones and pull/shred meat before serving. All or some of the rendered fat can be mixed into the meat.</li>
    </ol>
