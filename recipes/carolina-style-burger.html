    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I'm showing you how to do a <strong>"whole hog"</strong> barbecue without a 6-foot-long barbecue pit, which you <em>probably</em> don't have, and without a whole hog, which you <em>definitely</em> don't have. While you probably could get those things if you really needed to, by using this experimental, mini version, you really don't have to. Serve on buns.</p>
